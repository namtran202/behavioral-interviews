# Ownership
## 1. Definition
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.”

<summary><b>Tell me a about a tough decision you made during a project.</b></summary>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Situation: </b><br>
        - Used to handle large volumes of financial data. During a rountine check, I discovered a significant issue where duplicate data entries were causing inaccuracies in our financial database<br>
        - This was particularly concerning as the quarterly report of total sales and revenue was due in a few days, and these inaccuracies could lead to incorrect financial statements being presented to higher level<br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Task:</b><br>
        - My task was to decide whether to temporarily stop the reporting process to investigate and resolve the duplicate data issue, potentially delaying the quarterly report, or to proceed with the current data, risking the accuracy of the financial report.<br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Action:</b><br>
        - Analyze the potential impact of both options. Halting the report to address the duplicates would delay the report, impacting business decisions. But proceeding with the flawed data could result in incorrect financial statements, leading to severe financial and reputational consequences.<br>
        - Discussed with my team leader and financial team to gather their insights and understand the potential risks and benefits of each option<br>
        - After discussion and consideration, I prioritized the accuracy and integrity of the financial report, even though it meant delaying the report.<br>
        - Communicated my decision to the director of the department, explaining the rationale and the steps we would take to resolve the issue and minimize the delay.<br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Result</b><br>
        - My tean was able to rectify the issue and clean the data before generating the final report. <br>
        - Although the report was delayed by a few days, the director appreciated the transparency and our commitment to data accuracy. The final report was accurate and reliable, protecting the company from potential financial and reputational damage.
